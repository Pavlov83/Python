Booleans (True or False)
Numbers can be integers(1 and 2), floats(1.1 and 1.2), fractions( 1/2 and 2/3) or complex numbers
Strings are sequences of Unicode characters, e.g. an HTML document
Bytes and byte arrays e.g. a Jpeg image file
Lists are ordered sequences of values
Tuples are ordered immutable sequences of values
Sets are unordered bags of values
Dictionaries are unordered bags of key-value pairs

There  are more types of objects like module,function,method,file and compiled code

Booleans :
  >>>size = 1
  >>>size < 0
  False
  
  >>>size = 0
  >>>size < 0
  False
  
  >>>size = -1
  >>>size < 0
  True
  
  Numbers: Python supports integers and floating point numbers.There is no declaration to distinguish them; Python tells them apart by the presence or absence of a decimal point.
  
  >>>type(1)
  <class 'int'>
  >>>isinstance(1,int)
  True
  >>> 1 + 1
  2
