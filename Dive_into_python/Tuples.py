#A tuple is an immutable list.Once it"s created, you cannot add or remove items.
my_tuple = ('a','b',True,123)

# The tuples can be sliced exactly like lists.They are faster than lists.

# In python you can use a tuple to assign multiple values at once.
>>> v = ('a',2,True)
>>> (x,y,z,) = v

>>>x

'a'

>>>y

2
