#Python consists of 12 datatypes

#Numeric datatypes int float bool complex

#sequence datatypes str,list,tuple,range

#mapping type dict

#we can compare objects:

'''
if a == b:   compares the values

if a is b:   compares if the object is the same

if type(a) is type(b):  compares the type of a and type of b

The objects can be mutable or immutable, the mutable objects such as lists
can have their value changed,Immutable objects such as strings simply return a value
